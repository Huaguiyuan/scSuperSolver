Top-level usage:
    - build Controller from config file; this triggers buiding instances of 
        ConfigData, Environment, Logger, and State.
    - call selfConsistentCalc() on Controller, if it returns true it worked
    - logResults() and examine output

Spectrum is a big ball of static functions which take a State and some 
additional data, do some math, and emit results.

Tests for individual classes are built to test_(Class).out by make.
